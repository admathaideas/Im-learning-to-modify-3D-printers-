==================================

trying to explore using diferent materials on any 3d printer. modifications mechanical changes I can do need help with arduino programing updates.to see new hardware and run new hardware with update settings to see E3d v6 hot end on soliddoddle 2 I set up a boden style feed to exterior also with bodentube. I  want to build a new platform with 7 hotends and filliments non stop printing in seven colors anyone want to take a ride. Also a little hot spoon that trails the extuders heating plastic near melting temp right in front of exruder.this will ensure a fused deposition and strength to part and more oneness of memory to the rigidity of the builds .This is the problem with 3d printing right now in being used in practical applications. I built a replacement knob for hatch back of toyota sienna mini van .it broke after 10 openings due to delamination.not fused deposition NFFD. Who want's to solve these problems? We can make A TEAM.
